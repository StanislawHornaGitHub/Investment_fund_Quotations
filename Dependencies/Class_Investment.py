.DESCRIPTION
    Definition file of investment class. 
    Class is data structure to store and calculate results of a single investment.
    Investment is agreed to be a set of Investment funds, where each of have following properties:
        - Fund ID <- ID from Analizy.pl website
        - BuyDate <- date when particular fund was bought
        - Money <- amount of money used to by fund's participation units
        
    To have the class to function correctly you need to pass an instance of ListOfFunds
    to class constructor.
    
.INITIALIZATION
    To create an instance of this class you need to use keywords.
    By default class was meant to be a attribute of InvestmentWallet class
    Keywords for required variables:
        -InvestmentDetails <- dict structure in following format:
                {
                    <Fund_ID_1> : {
                        "BuyDate": "<yyyy-MM-dd>",
                        "Money": "<int_or_float>"
                    },
                    <Fund_ID_2> : {
                        "BuyDate": "<yyyy-MM-dd>",
                        "Money": "<int_or_float>"
                    }
                }
        
        - FundsList <- an instance of ListOfFunds with already downloaded data from web
